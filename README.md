# Drone-Trajectory-Planning
In this project a drone was given an initial state (position and velocity in 3D space) and a final state. Using numerical optimal control techniques, an optimal trajectory was determined.

To get an overview of this project, look at the PDF document. The animations are provided to help visualize the optimal numerical control.

All code was written in Matlab
