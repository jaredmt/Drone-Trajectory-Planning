# Drone-Trajectory-Planning
In this project a drone was given an initial state (position and velocity in 3D space) and a final state. Using numerical optimal control techniques, an optimal trajectory was determined.

To get an overview of this project, review the [PDF document](https://github.com/jaredmt/Drone-Trajectory-Planning/blob/master/Drone%20Trajectory%20Planning%20Project%20-%20Ticotin.pdf). The animations are provided to help visualize the optimal numerical control.

All code was written in Matlab
